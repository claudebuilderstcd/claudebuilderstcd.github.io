Great news! API credits are now being distributed to club members who have completed both registration forms.

## How to Get Your Credits

1. Make sure you've filled out both the **Interest Form** and **Check-in Form**
2. Create an account at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) using your `@tcd.ie` email
3. Find your Organization ID (see our [FAQ](/faq) for instructions)
4. Credits will be added within 48 hours

## Important Reminder

Use your **console.anthropic.com** Org ID, NOT your claude.ai Org ID. These are separate systems!

If you have any questions, reach out on Discord or check our FAQ page.
