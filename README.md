[Claude Builder Club Check-in Form](https://www.jotform.com/253566966596075): To get Claude Pro and API credits, fill out this form after attending our events!

## Special notice for API credits

Students must use their **console.anthropic.com** Org ID, NOT their **claude.ai** Org ID. API credits won't process otherwise.

Claude user and developer accounts are separate systems; both must use `<your_handle>@tcd.ie` email address for credits to be awarded

Find the correct Org ID at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) → Settings → Organization. (It's ok if the page redirects to "platform.claude.com")

After resubmission, credits will be awarded the next Friday.
