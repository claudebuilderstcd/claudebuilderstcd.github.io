## Special notice for API credits

You must use your [**console.anthropic.com**](https://console.anthropic.com) Org ID, NOT **claude.ai** Org ID. API credits won't process otherwise.

Claude user and developer accounts are separate systems; both must use `<your_handle>@tcd.ie` email address for credits to be awarded

Find the correct Org ID at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) → Settings → Organization. (It's ok if the page redirects to "platform.claude.com")
